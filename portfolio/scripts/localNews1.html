        <h2>Florida lawmakers unanimously pass bill to combat squatting</h2>
        <p>March 8, 2024 - State lawmakers have unanimously passed a bill to combat squatting.</p>
        <p>This comes after an investigation in jacksonville,done by News4JAX, exposing how a loophole in the law allowed people to live rent-free in a home for weeks while the property's owner wasn't allowed on the premises. The bill would close that loophole, and it's now headed to the governor's desk.</p>
        <p>The bill allows law enforcement to immediately remove squatters who do not have a lease authorized by the property owner. It also adds criminal penalties, including designating intentionally presenting a fraudulent lease as a misdemeanor and making it a felony to intentionally sell or lease someone else's property or intentionally cause more than $1,000 in property damage while squatting or trespassing.</p>
